## Things learned
# storing fstrings as variables
# learned __name__ and __main__
#   done to force the program only to work as the main program of something called a 'module'
#   this is useful to make the program only run the script if it's not part of another script
# You can just do terminating statements at the end of if statements instead of using else
# Can define variables in arguments? Why??
